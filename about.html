            <h6 class="about-title">I am a designer from Romania, Constanta.

In 2017 I moved to Copenhagen and started the Multimedia Design & Communication programme at KEA.</h6>
            <h2 class="title-flex margin">Work Experience</h2>
            <h6 class="about-title">Fotostory (Graphic Designer) - Working at Fotostory for over 3 months, a print house from my city was a great opportunity for me to test my punctuality and teamwork. I have acquired knowledge about DTP (Desktop Publishing) and website maintaining in addition to photo editing and logo design. It was a great summer job that I have enjoyed.
<br>
99Designs (Freelancer) - Through this platform I have won my first logo contest at the age of 14. This has given me the confidence and boost to pursue my career as a freelancer in this field.

In the present, I have won more than 10 contests and have been selected as a runner-up for more than 20 times.

Working as a freelancer I had the opportunity to create the visual indentity for over 30 brands.
